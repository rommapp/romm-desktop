// Moving a save between the server and the emulator.
//
// A native launch is the one place where the shell owns a save file RomM also
// has a copy of, so it is the one place the two can disagree. What to do about a
// disagreement is decided in plan.ts; this is the part that asks and the part
// that moves bytes, and the rule that shapes all of it is that nothing here may
// lose a save.
//
// Two entry points, at the two ends of a launch. `pullSave` runs before the
// emulator starts: it asks what the server has and writes it to disk when the
// server's copy should win. `pushSave` runs after the emulator exits and sends
// what changed. Between them the emulator is running and none of this is.
//
// Like the firmware mirror, none of this can fail a launch. A server that cannot
// be reached, a user without the right scope, a device the server has forgotten
// and a body that is not the shape it should be all end the same way: no save
// moves, and the game starts anyway.

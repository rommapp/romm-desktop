// Talking to RomM's API for the two things save sync has to do that a plain
// download does not: send a body, and prove the request is not cross-site.
//
// Electron's `net.request` is what the ROM and firmware downloads use, but it
// hands back a stream and takes no body, so the JSON and multipart calls here go
// through the session's own `fetch` instead -- the same session, so the same
// authentication either way, with no credential ever passing through this code.
//
// Nothing here throws except on a cancel. "Could not ask" is a value: the caller
// decides what it means, and for save sync it always means the same thing, which
// is to leave the local file alone.
